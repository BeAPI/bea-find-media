# BEA - Media Analytics

If you want to see which media is used and where ? This plugin is for you !

By installing this plugin you will index where your media are used, display further informations about how they are used and also warn you about deleting used ones.
Therefore, you will easily [delete unused medias](#unused-media).

# How ?

A table is created for indexing where media are used. This is done when saving contents but could also be forced with the [wp-cli command](#force-indexation) or just by activating the plugin. 

# Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 4.6+
- Tested up to 4.9.3.
- PHP 5.6+

# Installation

At plugin activation, a single event will be added in order to index your contents. It generally takes 10-15 min to do so.

At plugin deactivation, all data stored by this plugin will be **deleted** to ensure not to weighing the DB and also for further safe reactivation.

## WordPress

- Download and install using the built-in WordPress plugin installer.
- Site activate in the "Plugins" area of the admin.
- Optionally drop the entire `bea-media-analytics` directory into mu-plugins.
- Nothing more, this plugin is ready to use !

## [Composer](http://composer.rarst.net/)

- Nothing more, this plugin is ready to use !

### Third party support

## For developers

### WP-Cli

[WP-CLi](http://wp-cli.org) has been implemented to execute some useful commands.

#### Force indexation

Only on the given site, an indexation of all retrieved data from all supported contents : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site`
 
##### Multisite

Optionally on a multisite :
* for a site : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url={url}`
* for the entire network : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url={url}`
* for all sites of all networks : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url=$(wp site list --fields=url)`

#### Unused media

Quickly retrieve unused media for the current site (even with Content Sync Fusion).

##### List

List all unused media : `wp bea_media_analytics unused list`

##### Delete

Delete all unused media : `wp bea_media_analytics unused delete`

### REST Api

The [REST Api](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) has been used to display the number of usage for an attachment. The route `exemple.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/{id}/` will return a custom field called `bea_media_analytics_counter` which represents how many times it has been used into supported contents.

### JSON API

WordPress is working a lot with the JSON API, that's why why the `bea_media_analytics_counter` attribute has been added into attachment's JSON responses.
