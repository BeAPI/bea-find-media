# BEA - Media Analytics

If you want to see which media is used and where ? This plugin is for you !

By installing this plugin you will index where your media are used, display further informations about how they are used and also warn you about deleting used ones. 

# How ?

A table is created for indexing where media are used. This is done when saving contents but could also be forced with the [wp-cli command](#force-indexation) or just by activating the plugin. 

# Requirements

- [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) 4.7+
- Tested up to 4.9.1.
- **PHP 7.0** is required !!

# Installation

At plugin activation, a single event will be added in order to index your contents. It generally takes 10-15 min to do so.

At plugin deactivation, all data stored by this plugin will be **deleted** to ensure not to weighing the DB and also for further safe reactivation.

# What ?

## Features 

For now the supported contents for indexation are post types by focusing on :

### Third party support

This plugin has third party support with following plugins :

* [Content Sync Fusion](https://github.com/BeAPI/bea-content-sync-fusion) : the usage counter will now consider synced sites to reveal how many times a media has been used across all synchronized sites.

## For developers

### WP-Cli

#### Force indexation

[WP-CLi](http://wp-cli.org) has been implemented to execute, only on the given site, an indexation of all retrieved data from all supported contents : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site`
 
##### Multisite

Optionally on a multisite :
* for a site : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url={url}`
* for the entire network : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url={url}`
* for all sites of all networks : `wp bea_media_analytics index_site --url=$(wp site list --fields=url)`

### REST Api

The [REST Api](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) has been used to display the number of usage for an attachment. The route `exemple.com/wp-json/wp/v2/media/{id}/` will return a custom field called `bea_media_analytics_counter` which represents how many times it has been used into supported contents.

### JSON API

WordPress is working a lot with the JSON API, that's why why the `bea_media_analytics_counter` attribute has been added into attachment's JSON responses.
